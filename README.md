# pdfminer_go

This is a port of Python [pdfminer.six](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six) which is community maintained fork of [pdfminer](https://github.com/euske/pdfminer) for go. It is entirely written. Referenced also [https://github.com/dslipak/pdf](https://github.com/dslipak/pdf)

#### Its under development. Trying to make an alpha release after 6 months today.

Todos

- [ ] Added RC4 and Test
- [ ] Add ASCII85 Decode --> Adobe Implementation
- [X] Add ASCII85 HexDecode

Problems

- [X] I know now its not a proper GO package structure. I am not a golang developer. As I gain more experience and everything falls in place, I will restructure the project. 
- [X] Now I am not thinking too much about code quality. I will rethink about that when things falls everything in place.
